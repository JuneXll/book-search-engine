## Book Search Engine
## Deployable link: https://secure-dawn-28892.herokuapp.com/

## Summary:
This project was provided with a source code that was already fully operational. The application was modified to work with the apollow server, apollo client and GraphQl instead of the RESTful API that was originally provided.

The following files were modified:
- server.js to use the apollo server
- app.js to use the apollo client
- schema folder was created to contain Graphql typeDefs and resolvers
- queries.js and mutation.js files were added to the utils file
